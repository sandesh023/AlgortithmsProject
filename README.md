# AlgortithmsProject

In this project we have used Turneyâ€™s Pointwise Mutual Information(PMI) method of semantic orientation to get the sentiments of 1 lakh tweets mined. Semantic orientation involves calculating association of various keywords in the tweets with positive cum negative words. Key words have been determined using the words which have maximum probability of occurrence as well as which occures maximum time in the tweets overall.
